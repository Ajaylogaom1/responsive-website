                Parents may send their own children to a private
                schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because
                their countries do
                not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or
                because the
                children have to work for money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education for
                girls.The city of Alexandria in
                Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
                Greece. There, the
                great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse
                of literacy and
                organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
                society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed
                knowledge,
                values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                skills that could
                be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time
                of the Middle
                Kingdom</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post
                to reach students who couldn't be on a university campus.[1] By the early 1900s, communication
                technologies improved and distance education took to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the
                University of Wisconsin began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station
                dedicated to educational broadcasting.[1] Soon after, access to higher education was again expanded
                through the invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. The
                University of Iowa began to experiment with television for educational purposes in the 1930s. It was not
                until the 1950s, when the FCC began to reserve television frequencies for educational purposes, that
                telecourses caught the attention of the public. The value of television for education was furthered by
                the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in 1967. </p>
